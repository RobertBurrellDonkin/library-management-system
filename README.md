# Library Management System with RESTful API

## Assumptions
* Java 8 is now end of life, has known security vulnerability 
and is not supported by SpringBoot 3. The language used is consistently
**Java 8+** (rather than **Java 8**). Let's assume Java 17 is an acceptable compromise.
* Let's assume that library is intended to be reused at the microservice level by
calling the RESTful API, rather than as a Java library. So no need for a multi-module
set up.
